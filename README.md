# Frequent_Based_Patterns

The aim is to solve the problems related to performance optimization and the read operations for DFS systems with a graph-based algorithm. Graphs are used to trace interactions between data sets and the frequency of their usage, which helps in identifying the factors that affect data access behaviors. The machine  learning  model  like  Long  Short-Term  Memory (LSTM) is used for further optimization. Previous data access sequences are used to train the LSTM model for predicting frequent  patterns  which  helps  in  reducing latency and enhancing read operation efficiently. The project provides insights to gain practical experience in technologies such as graph  theory  and  machine  learning  along  with  providing optimization of DFS performance for real-world applications in the era of big data
